## Overview 
  
  The project is in support of Kate, to generate a business presentation that supports establishing a bike share enterprise in Des Moines, IA. The source data on rides, customers and locations is from "NYC Citi Bike", already an operation in New York city. 

   ### Purpose
   To prepare a visualization business proposal that will use data-based dashboards and a data-analysis story to support creation of a new company for bicycle sharing/renting in Des Moines. Data is from the "NYC Citi Bike" bike-share business for August 2019, used as the model. Data handling and presentation Dashboards and Story building are created using the "Tableau Public" web-based software tool.
 
   The deliverables are: 
   - Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
   - Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
   - Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation
   

   ### Resources
  * Data/content source file: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv
  * Software: Windows10, Python 3.8.3, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code 1.49.1, Tableau Public
